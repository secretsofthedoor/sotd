       The History Of SOTD
    </h1>
    <p>
    <h4>31st August 2024</h4>
    </p>
  
  <hr>
  
  <h3>
    
  
    At the time of writing this, 55 months have passed since SOTD was created.
  </h3>
  
  <h3>
    But here's how it started
  </h3>
  <h3>
    On the 13th of January 2020, at approximately 11:15am, two people discovered a door.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    Luckily, they were in possession of a tool, which would later become "the door tool".
  </h3>
  <h3>
    They stayed at the door for around 10 minutes.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    When they left the door, the door was no longer an ordinary door. The door had secrets.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    Shortly afterwards, they mentioned "The Secrets Of The Door" to many people, without saying what it was
  </h3>
  <h3>
    This led to many people being curious about what these "Secrets Of The Door" were
  </h3>
  <h3>
    So they decided to create SOTD (Secrets Of The Door).
  </h3>
  <h3>
    They told everybody that to join SOTD they must find out the Secrets Of The Door
  </h3>
  <h3>
    They declared that to find out the Secrets Of The Door, they must <i>"use the door tool on the door"</i>
  </h3>
  <h3>
    On the 15th of January 2020, they made the SOTD website (this website).
  </h3>
  <h3>
    They then published clues on the website, which are still available to read.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    By then, a lot of people were attempting to find out the door's secrets.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    On the 31st of January 2020, 2 people working together used the door tool on the door and found out the Secrets Of The Door.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    These people, who are codenamed "Orie" and "EBT" became members of SOTD.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    In March 2020, coronavirus meant that nobody was able to be in the premises which the door is on
  </h3>
  <h3>
    In the next few months after that, SOTD's popularity decreased.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    However, the four members of SOTD were still regularly discussing it.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    There was talk of reinstating SOTD after covid, but this never happened.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    SOTD stopped in June 2020.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    The clues are still available to read on the website.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    The door still stands today, holding great secrets.
  </h3>
  <h3>
    And for anybody who did not complete SOTD before it stopped, the Secrets Of The Door will always remain a mystery.
  </h3>
